# Android Testing App 🚀

This Android testing app demonstrates the functionality of **Deep Links**, **Implicit Intents**, **Explicit Intents**, and **Broadcast Receivers**. It serves as a simple yet effective way to test and understand how these components work in Android development.

## Features ✨

### 1. Deep Links 🔗
- The app is configured to handle deep links that navigate directly to specific screens or perform actions within the app.
- Learn how to use intent filters in the Android Manifest to capture deep link URLs.

### 2. Implicit Intents 📲
- Demonstrates the use of implicit intents to perform actions like opening a browser, sending a message, or sharing content to other apps without explicitly specifying the target component.
- Example: Share text to social media, open a map location, etc.

### 3. Explicit Intents ➡️
- Shows how to use explicit intents to start activities within the app or communicate between components.
- Example: Navigate between activities within the app by specifying the target activity.

### 4. Broadcast Receivers 📡
- The app includes a sample broadcast receiver that listens for system-wide broadcast messages and reacts accordingly.
- Example: Listen for changes in connectivity or battery status, and handle broadcasted events in the app.
